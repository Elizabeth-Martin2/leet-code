# Introduction
This repository is where I organize and track my progress in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design. Each folder is structured around different problem types, emphasizing efficiency, clean code, and recognizing problem-solving patterns.

This repository follows [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2), which provides a structured roadmap for mastering DSA concepts step by step, from basics to advanced topics. Problems are categorized accordingly, and I revisit solutions to refine my approach over time.

# Overview
## Goals
This repository is meant for progressive learning, covering:

- Data Structures: Arrays, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists
- Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy
- Problem-Solving Strategies: Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Backtracking
- Time & Space Complexity Analysis
- Object-Oriented Programming & Design Patterns
- UML Diagramming & Software Architecture Case Studies

## Purpose
1. Structured Learning:
    - Each algorithm category has its own folder with progressively harder problems.
    - Focus is on understanding concepts, not just solving problems.

2. Code Implementation & Optimization:
    - Each solution includes time & space complexity analysis.
    - I revisit solutions to improve efficiency over time.

3. Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD):
    - Design pattern implementations (e.g., Singleton, Factory).
    - Case studies of real-world systems using UML diagrams.
